I am fascinated by AI's potential to positively impact our daily lives. With that interest, I'm on a path to become an AI Engineer with the goal of integrating existing AI models to products to make human lives far easier. 

Currently, I'm a freshman majoring in Computer Science at the University of Information Technology - VNUHCM.
